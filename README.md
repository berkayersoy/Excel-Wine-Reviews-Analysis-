# Excel Wine Reviews Analysis
Found a dataset on wine reviews, decided to do a fast ad-hoc style analysis on it with Excel to see if it returns some interesting insights.
The data set comes from kaggle by the author zackthoutt, the initial dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews

My initial questions that I wanted to answer from this data set were:
1) Is there a correlation between wine price and rating ?
2) Which price range gives us the top ratings with less bucks ?
3) Are my personal favorite wine varieties (Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon) rated high in the scale ?

So the dataset was in csv format so I easily loaded into my excel sheet. Since this is going to be an ad-hoc analysis fast pivot table creation and looking for insights I didn't see the use of formatting the data as a table which would prevent reference problems later on.
